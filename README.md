The Airbnb Property Dashboard aims to address the challenge of understanding pricing trends and occupancy patterns across various property listings. By integrating data from listings, reviews, and calendar bookings, the dashboard seeks to provide insights into how property size, location, and time affect pricing and revenue. This analysis helps property owners and investors make informed decisions in a competitive market while also identifying potential areas for improvement or investment.



### 1. Data Preparation:
I uploaded three datasets into Tableau: listings, reviews, and calendar. These datasets were joined using the common column listing_id. The listings table contains property details, reviews provides user feedback, and calendar holds booking and pricing information.

### 2. Key Visualizations & Insights

- Average Price by Bedroom Count:
Properties with more bedrooms command higher average prices. Notably, 6-bedroom listings average $584.8, while 1-bedroom listings are priced at $96.2. This shows a strong correlation between property size and pricing.

- Price by Zip Code:
Zip code 98177 has the highest average price, while other areas like 98115 and 98103 are also priced significantly above average. This suggests certain areas are more premium, possibly due to location desirability.

- Revenue Trend:
The revenue graph shows consistent growth over the year, peaking towards the end of the year with a revenue above 2 million. This could reflect a growing demand for Airbnb properties.

- Listings Distribution by Bedroom Count:
One-bedroom listings dominate the market, with 1,811 entries, making up the majority of listings compared to other categories. Larger properties (e.g., 6-bedroom) are much rarer, with only 5 listings, yet they command the highest prices.

### Conclusion
This dashboard provides valuable insights into Airbnb pricing trends, highlighting how property size and location impact pricing, as well as showing a strong annual revenue trend.
